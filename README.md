# Project Overview: Animal Trading Cards
In this project, I have the opportunity to demonstrate my new web development skills by recreating a webpage from a design prototype.

This is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, I am given a design prototype that needs to be translated into an actual, functional website.

The design prototype used in this project (shown in the image below) is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognise from a popular animated film. I will be creating a card like this and swapping out the fish with an animal of my choice.

In most cases, designers only provide the design prototype and nothing else. For this project, I have also been given the HTML, so I can focus on the main point of this project—which is to demonstrate my ability to add style to a page using CSS.
